        <h2 class="text-center">For Managers</h2>
        <p class="text-center"><em>Are you trying to convince your manager to send you to DjangoCon US? Send them the email below to convince them.</em></p><br />
        <p>Dear <em>[manager's name]</em>,</p>
        <p><em>[Company]</em> has been using Django for about <em>[period of time]</em>, and during this time our code quality, test coverage, and user experience <em>[or insert other improvements]</em> have been greatly improved. But Django holds more potential for our team, and I think we can make many more improvements to our codebase with other Django tools and libraries. </p>
        <p>DjangoCon US, the North American conference for Django developers, is quickly approaching in Spokane, WA, from August 13-18, and we should not pass up the chance to attend. This conference presents a unique opportunity to learn from Django developers from all over the world and discuss how we could be using Django in innovative ways. Out of the 40 talks on the program, I am most looking forward to attending <em>[talk #1]</em> and <em>[talk #2]</em> because they would provide immediate benefit to our team.</p>
        <p>Here is a breakdown of my costs to attend:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Registration: $645 for a <a href="https://ti.to/defna/djangocon-us-2017">corporate ticket</a></li>
            <li>Airfare:</li>
            <li>Transportation:</li>
            <li>Hotel: $129/night at the <a href="/venue/">Hotel RL by Red Lion</a></li>
            <li>Meals: breakfast, lunch, and snacks included in conference registration </li>
            <li>Tutorials: $150 per tutorial, and I would like to attend <em>[Tutorial #1]</em> and <em>[Tutorial #2]</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>After attending DjangoCon US, I would submit a summary that will include links to the conference videos that would most benefit our team and my recommendations for how we can implement what I learned. I hope you understand why attending DjangoCon US would be great for me and <em>[organization]</em>! You can learn more about DjangoCon US by visiting <a href="https://2017.djangocon.us/">https://2017.djangocon.us/</a>.</p>
        <p>Thank you for your consideration, </p>
        <p><em>[Your name]</em></p>
        <br />
        <p class="text-center"><em>If there are further questions that your manager may have that you don’t have the answer to, we’re happy to try! Send us an email at <a href="mailto:hello@djangocon.us">hello@djangocon.us</a>. We want to see you in Spokane for DjangoCon US 2017!</em></p>

                        <p>The biggest obvious benefit to employees is being exposed to the conference material. The larger, but less obvious, benefit is the community interactions and connections your employees will make. Have a problem with a library? It's possible your employee knows one of the core maintainers or someone else who uses it and can reach out for some quick advice that simply isn't possible without the human connection. </p>
