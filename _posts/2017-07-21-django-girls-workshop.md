title: "Django Girls Workshop is Coming to DjangoCon Spokane!"
---

We are currently accepting applications from women and non-binary participants, coaches of any gender, and sponsors to take part in a free, one-day Django programming workshop on August 12. 

Participants do not need to be Python or Django experts. In fact, you do not need to have any programming experience. Absolute beginners are welcome and encouraged to apply!

Participants will learn the basics of programming, including HTML, CSS, Python, and will build and publish a basic blog using Django! We have awesome coaches, who will work with small groups to work through the tutorial at your own pace. Food and goodie bags will be provided. We even have some great prizes you can win in a raffle!

Django Girls is a non-profit organization created to encourage and inspire women and non-binary individuals from around the world to pursue tech! Our workshop is funded entirely through donations from generous sponsors and organised and coached by volunteers! Please reach out if youâ€™d like to give back to the community through sponsorship or volunteering.

A special thank you to our major sponsor [Startup Spokane Central](http://startupspokane.com/) for providing our workshop space and local support.

See our [website](https://djangogirls.org/spokane/) for more information and to apply. You can email us at [Spokane@DjangoGirls.org](mailto:Spokane@DjangoGirls.org). Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/DjangoGirlsSpo) for updates too!

Hope to see you there! 

The Organizers, 

Alexis, Brent, Katherine, and Rebecca!
