A special thanks to [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/) for their 
Gold sponsorship this year!

JetBrains is sponsoring DjangoCon US again this year, and they'll have
a booth in the expo hall along with two PyCharm team members:
[Paul Everitt](https://twitter.com/paulweveritt) and
[Dmity Filippov](https://twitter.com/filippovdmitry)

If you’re attending DjangoCon US and have any questions, suggestions,
complaints or just want a sneak peek at the PyCharm’s future, come visit
them in the expo hall. They’ll have various JetBrains goodies, they can
do live demos, and they’re going to have a raffle for free PyCharm
Professional Edition licenses.
