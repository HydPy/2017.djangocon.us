Alicia is the founder and creator of [Pevo](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pevo/id852392358?mt=8), an iOS app in 6 languages that helps domestic violence survivors escape abuse and connects them with local resources. She is the director of the Atlanta chapter of [Women Who Code](https://www.womenwhocode.com/atlanta), and was featured in the Apple Worldwide Developers keynotes in 2015 and 2016. You can follow her on Twitter at [@Fineblkwoman](https://twitter.com/Fineblkwoman), or check out her website, [Coffee, Women, and Tech](http://www.coffeewomenandtech.com/). 

Alicia will discuss the challenges she faced as an African American woman in becoming an iOS developer at the age of 51. As a self-taught developer, she created a mobile app dedicated to helping victims escape domestic violence and abuse. She has seen the best and worst of the tech community. As demonstrated by her app, she believes that the tech industry can improve and change lives if we open our arms, embrace change, and think about how women can change the way we see and create apps.

Ana is currently a backend developer and has given talks at DjangoCon Europe, PyCon US, EuroPython, and Django Under the Hood, among others. She has been the maintainer and Google Summer of Code mentor for the [Systers Portal](https://github.com/systers/portal). Recently Ana became the organizer of the [PyLadies London](https://www.meetup.com/PyLadiesLondon/) meetup. Learn more about Ana on her [website](https://ana-balica.github.io/), or follow her on Twitter at [@anabalica](https://twitter.com/anabalica)!

The Django documentation section on testing starts with this: "Automated testing is an extremely useful bug-killing tool for the modern Web developer.” Nobody can argue with that. Testing is an integral part of modern software development, and Ana’s talk will offer an in-depth overview of how the Django testing framework evolved; showcase some common techniques, tools, and best practices; talk about speed improvements; and guide you through a real-world example of testing a Django app. Testing is fun, isn't it?

Tracy is a designer, developer, and entreprenerd living in Toronto, Canada. She's the author of [Hello Web App](https://hellowebbooks.com/#packages) and [Hello Web App: Intermediate Concepts](https://hellowebbooks.com/#packages), and her third book, [Hello Web Design](https://hellowebbooks.com/#packages), is forthcoming. A frequent speaker, she has been onstage at DjangoCon US, PyCon US, EuroPython, Write The Docs, and many other conferences. She's also an avid outdoorswoman and would love to go on a hike with you. You can find out more about Tracy on her [website](https://limedaring.com/), or follow her on Twitter at [@limedaring](https://twitter.com/limedaring)! 

Over the last 10 years (and really, her entire life), Tracy's struggled with anxiety while running her own business, navigating negotiations, and self-publishing several books. This keynote will go through recommendations for keeping your sanity in a dog eat dog world, reducing anxiety, feeling comfortable with negotiation, and above all, being the best advocate for yourself that you can be.

We're so excited to see these keynote addresses and hear the insights these speakers have to offer. Will you join us? Registration is still open, so [buy your ticket today](/tickets/)!
