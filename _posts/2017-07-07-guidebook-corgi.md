title: "Corgi Gifs and Aloha Fridays: Building Guidebook’s Culture"
---

At Guidebook, we have a few core beliefs.

We believe it should be simple and affordable for organizations to
connect with their audiences on their mobile devices. We believe in
powering a streamlined, intuitive process for building a mobile app—no
technical skills required.

We also believe that to make these things happen
(and to deliver the best possible product), we need to hire and retain
the best possible talent.

Pat Wadors, Head of HR at LinkedIn, [weighed in](https://business.linkedin.com/talent-solutions/blog/company-culture/2016/linkedins-head-of-hr-shares-why-company-culture-should-be-your-top-priority) 
on this very topic. When it comes to success, she said, 
“culture eats strategy for breakfast.”

To compete in today’s global market for the best team members, and to
keep our current team members engaged and successful, Guidebook has
implemented what can only be referred to as—a lot of fun stuff.
Some of our favorites include:

- Annual retreat (aka Guidetrip) to Lake Tahoe
- A killer snack and beverage spread in the kitchen (La Croix included)
- Catered in-office lunches
- Guidebook Gives Back: group volunteer days
- Flexible work hours and unlimited vacation time

Beyond this, we pay 100% of employees’ Medical, Dental, and Vision
benefits; offer commuter benefits; and more. Ultimately, we believe
in powering a culture that allows employee to thrive.
Whether it’s a rooftop ping pong table or a standing desk, 
we make it happen!

The best part of all this? We’re hiring! Check out our 
[careers](https://guidebook.com/careers/) page
here—we’d love to hear from you. And of course, be sure to use the
DjangoCon US 2017 mobile app all throughout the conference.
As Django users ourselves, the Guidebook team is pumped to
be a part of it!
