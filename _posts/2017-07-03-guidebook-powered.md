Guidebook is thrilled to power the DjangoCon US 2017 conference app!
We are particularly excited because our Guidebook engineering team
is proud to use Django to power our backend stack.  We appreciate
Django's detailed documentation, and the active community of developers
that improve Django every day. We’ve been on Django since about 0.9, 
and are looking forward to many more productive years with its ever
improving tool kit.

What is Guidebook? [Guidebook](https://guidebook.com/)
is a simple yet powerful mobile application builder that lets you create
an app in four easy steps — no technical skills required. Just choose
from a gallery of mobile app templates, select your features, and fill
it with content. Then publish in minutes to Google Play and the
Apple App Store.

Guidebook apps provide a best-in-class experience for users. Modern
layout and features mean navigation is a breeze. An interactive social
field provides a central place for event attendees to discover content, 
share photos, and engage in discussion. Real-time updates allow users
to receive notifications directly to their home screens during
events—even if the app isn’t active.

 
Guidebook can be used to build guides for a wide variety of
organizations such as:

- University of Oregon’s Mobile Campus Tour

  - Admissions staff provide prospective students an app-powered campus
  tour option. It includes GPS guidance to the next POI on campus, 
  audio narration in the words of a student ambassador, 
  and customizable interest form that captures prospective students
  right when they’re most interested.

- Oculus Connect developer conference

  - Event managers at the virtual reality company used Guidebook 
  to create an exceptional user experience at their conference. 
  The app includes beautifully detailed speaker bios with photos, 
  detailed demo sessions with capped attendance, and an attendee
  engagement platform with built-in networking.

- Computer History Museum app

  - Docents at the world’s largest collection of computer artifacts
  provide visitors with a handheld guide. Their app includes an RSS feed
  that pulls in blog articles about museum business, easy-to-navigate maps
  that walk visitors through galleries, and personalized to-do lists that
  allows users to list and check off their favorite exhibits.

a bit better. See you at DjangoCon!
