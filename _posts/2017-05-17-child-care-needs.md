title: "Do You Need Child Care for DjangoCon US 2017?"
---

As part of our commitment to inclusion, we are pleased to announce that DjangoCon US 2017 is currently working on providing child care for children of attendees. We plan to reimburse parents for children ages 5 and up for a week-long summer camp through the Spokane YMCA. Details about how to sign up, as well as developments in child care for children under 5 years of age, will be outlined in a future blog post.

To gauge demand, we ask that any attendees considering bringing their children (of any age) to DjangoCon US 2017 fill out this [Google Form](https://goo.gl/forms/KHaqEYdyRsijp74M2). We request that anyone who needs child care fill out this form as soon as possible, as the YMCA summer camp does have limited availability.
