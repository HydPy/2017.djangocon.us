Caktus offers a range of web services, including custom Django app 
development, discovery workshops, development team augmentation, and best practices consulting. We’ve built dozens of solutions for clients in higher education, financial services, media, entertainment, energy, and ICT4D. As [AWS Consulting Partners](https://aws.amazon.com/partners/find/partnerdetails/?id=001E000001N5gJTIAZ) , we’re qualified to help implement AWS tools for computing, networking, storage, databases, security, application services and security.

Some of our work:

- [A digital video archiving system](https://www.caktusgroup.com/case-study/moving-from-physical-tapes-to-amazon-glacier/) for iN DEMAND to make the move from physical to digital storage
- [An event management app](https://www.caktusgroup.com/case-study/live-event-management-app/) to help Discovery manage live events
- [The world’s first SMS-driven voter registration system](https://www.caktusgroup.com/case-study/worlds-first-sms-voter-registration-system/) for Libya
- [Team augmentation to enable website scaling](https://www.caktusgroup.com/case-study/team-augmentation-and-best-practices/) for Google Venture-backed startup CustomMade

This year, we’re celebrating 10 years of web apps done right. We attribute our success to four factors: building up both internal and external partnerships, focusing on the most valuable features first for our clients, our dedication to building scalable apps, and, most importantly, our sharp team. Read more about the benefits and implementation of these factors in our [Shipping Faster white paper](http://learn.caktusgroup.com/shipping-faster-django-team-improvements) .
