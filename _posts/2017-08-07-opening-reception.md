You're invited to the DjangoCon US 2017 Opening Reception! 

### Who
You! 

### What
A picnic in the park :evergreen_tree: for the DjangoCon US 2017 opening night 

### When
:calendar: Monday, August 14 

:clock7: 7:00-9:30 pm 

### Where
The Forestry Shelter at [Riverfront Park](https://my.spokanecity.org/riverfrontpark/). Riverfront Park is directly across the river from the conference hotel, the Hotel RL by Red Lion, and there is a convenient walking trail from the Hotel RL to the Forestry Shelter. Here is a [handy map](https://static.spokanecity.org/documents/riverfrontpark/information/rfp-map.pdf) to guide you! 

The Forestry Shelter is wheelchair accessible from the walking path to the restrooms (which are not wheelchair accessible, unfortunately). 

[Greenbluff Fresh](http://greenblufffresh.com/) will be on hand with tasty, dietary-restriction friendly, and locally sourced snacks and refreshing homemade lemonade. 

The opening reception will be free from alcohol but full of celebration and merriment! 

### Why
Why not? Picnics are awesome, food is tastiest :strawberry: when it's fresh and local, :lemon: lemonade rocks, and who doesn't want to spend a couple hours catching up with old friends and making new ones? 

See you there!
