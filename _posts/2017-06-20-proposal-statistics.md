We had a lot of excellent talk and tutorial submissions for DjangoCon US 2017.

Both the quantity and quality of the proposals were amazing. Sadly, we had only 40 talk and 6 tutorial slots, and many excellent talk and tutorial submissions couldn’t be accommodated. We’d like to provide you with some facts and figures about our review process:

- We had 218 talk and 27 tutorial submissions. That’s 25% more submissions than last year.
- More than 20 reviewers signed up to help us review talks and tutorials.
- We had 2,998 reviews total and 149 interactions with speakers over our two-week review period.

After the first round of reviews, there were 95 presentations with top votes. Out of those, we chose our 46 DjangoCon US 2017 talks and tutorials. 47% of our presentations are by women speakers.

The final decisions about our program were very difficult; we had enough excellent content to easily schedule two conferences. We’re very proud of the schedule we’ve put together and want to thank everyone who submitted a talk or proposal, even if it wasn’t selected. The quality of submissions was top notch, and we hope to see many of your proposals at other conferences or at DjangoCon US 2018.

Thanks also to all of our reviewers! We couldn’t have done this without you.

We are confident that DjangoCon US 2017 will be a great conference with many excellent talks and tutorials. We hope to see you in Spokane this summer!
