Our thanks to [REVSYS](http://www.revsys.com/) for sponsoring this year's DjangoCon US (along with previous years).

REVSYS specializes in performance and scalability, Django web application development, Systems Administration services and commercial support of many Open Source Software systems. They are consultants who are based out of Lawrence, KS (the birthplace of Django).

[REVSYS](http://www.revsys.com/) gives back to the Django community in many ways!

We're very lucky to have REVSYS' own [Jeff Triplett](https://twitter.com/webology) helping organize this year's conference! Jeff is also the President of [DEFNA](http://www.defna.org/) and served as our Program Chair in 2015 and 2016.

President and Founder [Frank Wiles](https://twitter.com/fwiles) also serves as the President of the [Django Software Foundation](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation/)

Visit [Team REVSYS](http://www.revsys.com/about/team/) to learn more about how the team at REVSYS continues to give back!
