abstract: Django is undoubtedly the first tool most of us reach for when building
  a web app, but the flexibility built into both Django itself and Django Rest Framework
  open up a universe of possibilities. We'll explore some less-conventional uses of
  this fast, flexible, and powerful combination.

title: Write an API for Almost Anything (or The Amazing Power and Flexibility of Django
  Rest Framework)

This talk will feature a few off-the-beaten-path applications of APIs. Since the combination of Django and DRF makes it so easy to get a simple API running, it becomes a very powerful, flexible, and expandable tool for a variety of uses. The only thing these applications may have in common is their need to share data across the web.
Whether you have not yet tested the waters of Django Rest Framework or you are a DRF veteran, this talk will inspire you to think both big and small when considering its potential uses.
