    Trying to keep up with the JavaScript ecosystem can be overwhelming. New
    tools release every month, and the benefits of a given library over any other is
    unclear. Join Django Unleashed author Andrew Pinkham as he shares his  experience
    learning React and helps demystify the JS ecosystem.

After an initial foray into JavaScript in 2011, I actively avoided learning or using JavaScript. Then, in early 2017, JamBon Software took on a project to build a bleeding-edge JavaScript web app in Facebook's React. Suddenly, I did not have a choice and had to learn JavaScript---versions 5 and 6---as well as Facebook's React library with the entire JavaScript and React ecosystems behind it.

This talk will give developers a framework to analyze the overwhelming number of tools in the JavaScript world by categorizing the types of problems currently being solved. By the end, you'll walk away with a mental framework of the solutions being built today.

We will start by looking at a history of JavaScript. This will allow us to discuss problems that developers need to solve in browsers when interacting with APIs. With a full understanding of the problems, we'll turn our attention to discussing the types of solutions available and quickly discuss how different libraries like Angular, Vue, Inferno, and Cycle implement these solutions.

The talk will then explain how to use React in tandem with Redux to build a tiny website. We will demonstrate how to use tools like Webpack, fetch, Promises, and thunks to enhance React to solve the problems previously discussed.

Finally, we'll end with a review of the material, and consider some of the topics being looked at by Facebook, Google and Microsoft.
