abstract:
    "The Django documentation section on testing starts with this: 'Automated testing is an extremely useful bug-killing tool for the modern Web developer.' Nobody can argue with that. Testing is an integral part of modern software development, and Ana’s talk will offer an in-depth overview of how the Django testing framework evolved; showcase some common techniques, tools, and best practices; talk about speed improvements; and guide you through a real-world example of testing a Django app. Testing is fun, isn't it?"
