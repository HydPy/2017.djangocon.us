abstract: Django is the undisputed king of web development in Python, but Flask is
  a scrappy young micro web framework that has attracted a lot of attention for its
  simplicity and shallow learning curve. Is there room for more than one web framework
  in Python? Learn about Flask, and how it compares to Django!

When it comes to web development in Python, Django isn't the only game in town. Flask is a scrappy young framework that takes a very different approach -- whereas Django ships with tons of features ready and eager to be used, Flask provides a bare minimum feature-set with rock-solid extensibility and incredible flexibility. This talk, given by a web developer who has experience with both frameworks, takes a good look at the pros and cons for both Flask and Django. If you've ever felt that Django is too hard to learn, or too inflexible, this is the talk for you!
