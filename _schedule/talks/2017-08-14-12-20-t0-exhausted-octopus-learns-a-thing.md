    This talk draws from education research, principles of mindfulness, and
    everything I tried in the past year of learning. This talk is not about burnout,
    rather, it's about intentionally adding learning to the life you have- a life
    that's not always perfect, not always optimal, but always yours.

Whether you work a draining job, work multiple jobs, have family responsibilities, or otherwise can't put 100% into learning a thing, there are still things you can do to optimize the time you do have to learn. This talk is a compassionate look at a problem many people face- how to learn when you're exhausted. How do you add knowledge in the face of reduced cognitive capacity? How do you balance the desire to learn with the need to take care of yourself? I'll talk about what I've learned over the past year, as my job responsibilities  increased, my partner moved to Sweden, my father was diagnosed with cancer, and I studied Django, Python, Linux, and embedded systems. In addition to specific recommendations, this talk focuses on starting, stopping (meditation), and sustaining learning in one's life. This talk is not about burnout, rather, it's about intentionally adding learning to the life you have- a life that's not always perfect, not always optimal, but always yours.
