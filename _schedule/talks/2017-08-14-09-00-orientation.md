    Kojo Idrissa *was* an accountant who got an MBA and taught at university in
    two different countries. He's *now* a new(ish) software engineer and is still
    trying to figure that out and grow into the role. He's spoken at tech conferences
    about spreadsheets, contributing to tech communities, Dungeons & Dragons, inclusion
    and privilege. You can find him online at http://kojoidrissa.com/ or as
    [@transition](https://twitter.com/Transition) on Twitter.

    Hi, I'm Ed! I'm a freelance web developer building fast, elegant sites with
    Python / Django. On the frontend, I love bringing beautiful designs to life
    using accessible HTML, (S)CSS, and JavaScript. Lately I've been playing with
    everyone's favorite toys: React and Redux.

    I've been contributing to [Mezzanine](https://github.com/stephenmcd/mezzanine/),
    a popular Django-based CMS, for several years now. I find great satisfaction
    in teaching and helping others in their programming journey and adventures
    with tech.
