abstract: Alicia will discuss the challenges she faced as an African American woman in becoming an iOS developer at the age of 51. As a self-taught developer, she created a mobile app dedicated to helping victims escape domestic violence and abuse. She has seen the best and worst of the tech community. As demonstrated by her app, she believes that the tech industry can improve and change lives if we open our arms, embrace change, and think about how women can change the way we see and create apps.
