This tutorial will be relevant to anyone who wants to build a content-managed website using Django. It will cover

- developer environment (just bring a laptop)
- installation
- how to structure your site
- creating and editing content (text, images, videos)
- simple theming
- adding users
- making your site live on the web
- buying and configuring a domain name

By the end of the session you'll have a working site, running the latest version of Wagtail. You can decide to use it as a disposable learning project or as the start of your new website. We'll use a collaborative, online developer environment - just bring your laptop!
